General API information
-----------------------

The Cloud Block Storage API is defined as a RESTful HTTP service that uses all aspects of the
HTTP protocol, including methods, URIs, media types, and response codes. Review the topics 
in this section to learn more about these API components and how to access and use the 
API for this service.

Like other products in the Rackspace Cloud suite, Cloud Block Storage shares a common token-based authentication system that allows seamless access between products and services. 

.. note::
   All requests to authenticate against and operate the service are performed using SSL 
   over HTTP (HTTPS) on TCP port 443.
