Sending requests to the API 
---------------------------------

You have several options for sending requests through an API:

-  Developers and testers might prefer to use the command-line tool
   cURL. For more information about cURL, see the `cURL
   website <http://curl.haxx.se/>`__. With cURL, you can send HTTP
   requests and receive responses back from the command line.

-  If you like to use a more graphical interface, the RESTClient for
   Mozilla Firefox works well for testing commands. For more
   information, see the `Mozilla RESTclient
   website <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/>`__.

-  You can download and install RESTClient, a Java application used to
   test RESTful web services. For more information, see the `Java
   application RESTClient
   website <http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/>`__.

This guide uses the API directly with cURL (`Chapter 4, *Using the API
directly by using cURL* <Using_the_API_directly_d1e060.html>`__).
